## Le Bandit Slot Gameplay & Overview

The base game takes place down a backstreet alley in urban France, with Smokey the racoon watching over the matrix as symbols fall from above.

The aim of the game is to form clusters of at least five matching symbols for a payout. The 10-A royals are the low-paying symbols, while the ankle clamp, cheese, beer, baguettes, and top hat are the high-paying symbols, offering the biggest wins.

As is the case with many Hacksaw titles, there are several bonus rounds to look forward to, including the Luck of the Bandit and All that Glitters is Gold rounds, which are inspired by the [luck of the Irish](https://stake.com/casino/group/irish).

## Symbols & Paytable

The Le Bandit pay table below indicates how much you earn when winning clusters form in the base game:

| Symbol | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9-10 | 11-12 | 13+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| J | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| Q | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| K | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| A | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| Ankle Clamp | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.70 | 2.50 | 7.50 | 25.00 |
| Cheese | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.70 | 2.50 | 7.50 | 25.00 |

| Baguettes | 0.50 | 0.70 | 1.00 | 1.50 | 5.00 | 15.00 | 50.00 |
| Top Hat | 1.00 | 1.50 | 2.00 | 3.00 | 10.00 | 30.00 | 100.00 |

## Super Cascades

When a winning cluster lands in the base game, all regular symbols that are the same as the winning symbols are removed from the reels and replaced by new ones from above. This continues until no new winning clusters form.

## Golden Squares & Special Symbols

When a winning cluster lands, the symbols that are removed from the grid via the cascade have their positions highlighted in gold. Should a rainbow symbol be on the grid at the same time, it activates any golden square and transforms the position into bronze, silver, or gold coins. Pot of gold and four-leaf clover symbols, which are the game’s special symbols, can also appear.

The coins that land offer a multiplier win and can be any of the following:

- Bronze coins = 0.2x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x, or 4x.
- Silver coins = 5x, 10x, 15x, or 20x.
- Gold coins = 25x, 50x, 100x, 250x, or 500x.

When the value of the coins is revealed, any four-leaf clovers in view add a multiplier to all coins and any pots of coins that are in view on adjacent squares (between 2x and 10x).

The role of pots of gold is to collect all coin values, storing the total value. All pots of gold award their value when the squares are no longer golden.

## Luck of the Bandit

If three FS scatters land, the Luck of the Bandit bonus round triggers, awarding eight free spins. Here, golden squares remain highlighted between spins until the rainbow symbol activates them. Each time two more FS scatters land, you are given two additional spins, while three more FS scatters award four spins.

If you land four scatters, you gain an upgrade to the All that Glitters is Gold bonus round.

## All that Glitters is Gold

This bonus round is triggered when four FS scatters are in view on any base game spin, giving you twelve free spins. All golden squares remain active until the end of the game, even after being activated by the rainbow symbol.

## Treasure at the End of the Rainbow

The Treasure at the end of the Rainbow bonus round can be triggered with five FS symbols. Here, golden squares remain active throughout, and a rainbow symbol is guaranteed to land on every spin. What’s more, only gold and silver coins can land.

## Bonus Buy Options

There are four [feature buy options](https://stake.com/casino/group/bonus-buy) in Le Bandit:

- BonusHunt FeatureSpins (3x the bet) = every spin is 5x more likely to trigger a bonus feature.
- Rainbow FeatureSpins (50x the bet) = each spin is guaranteed to land a rainbow symbol.
- Luck of the Bandit (100x the bet) = 8 free spins on this bonus game.
- All that Glitters is Gold (250x the bet) = 12 free spins on this bonus game.
