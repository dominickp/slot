**Le Bandit** is a standout title from Hacksaw Gaming that feels like a fever dream from the 1930s. It features a disgruntled, mustachioed raccoon named Luckie who is prowling the streets of France looking for more than just scraps.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the game looks, feels, and functions.

## 🎨 Visuals and Aesthetic

The game leans heavily into the **"rubber hose" animation style** popularized by early Disney and Fleischer Studios (think *Steamboat Willie* or *Cuphead*).

* **The Palette:** The base game uses a muted, sepia-toned palette that makes it look like an old film reel. When you hit a bonus round, the colors shift into vibrant, technicolor hues.
* **The Protagonist:** Luckie the Raccoon stands to the side of the reels, reacting to your wins with classic cartoon tropes—eye-pops, frantic gestures, and various disguises.
* **Symbol Design:** The symbols range from low-value 10-A card ranks to high-value "heist" items like traps, cheese, beer jugs, baguettes, and top hats.

## ⚙️ Core Game Mechanics

Le Bandit is a **6x5 grid slot** that uses a **Cluster Pay** system rather than traditional paylines.

### 1. Super Cascades

Whenever you land a winning cluster (5+ matching symbols touching vertically or horizontally), those symbols are removed. However, unlike standard cascades, **all instances** of the winning symbol type are removed from the entire grid, allowing for a massive influx of new symbols.

### 2. Golden Squares and Rainbows

This is the "meat" of the gameplay:

* **Golden Squares:** When a winning cluster is removed, the positions it occupied are highlighted as **Golden Squares**.
* **The Rainbow Symbol:** If a Rainbow symbol lands, it activates all currently highlighted Golden Squares.
* **The Reveal:** Activated squares transform into:
* **Bronze, Silver, or Gold Coins:** Cash prizes ranging from 0.2x to 500x.
* **Four-Leaf Clovers:** Multiplies adjacent coins by up to x10.
* **Pot of Gold:** Collects all coin values on the screen and stores them, then re-activates the squares to reveal new coins.

## 🎰 The Bonus Tiers

The game features three distinct bonus rounds, triggered by Landing FS (Free Spin) scatters.

| Bonus Name | Scatters | Feature Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Luck of the Leprechaun** | 3 FS | 8 Free Spins. Golden Squares remain highlighted between spins until they are activated by a Rainbow. |
| **All That Glitters Is Gold** | 4 FS | 12 Free Spins. Golden Squares **never disappear**, even after being activated by a Rainbow. They stay lit for the whole round. |
| **Treasure at the End of the Rainbow** | 5 FS | 12 Free Spins. Same as above, but you are **guaranteed** a Rainbow symbol to land on every single spin. |

## 🎬 Animations and Sound

The "vibe" is completed by a bouncy, gypsy-jazz soundtrack that speeds up during big wins or bonus rounds.

* **Win Animations:** Large wins trigger "Big Win" banners with vintage typography and flickering film grain effects.
* **Luckie's Interaction:** If you stay idle, Luckie might check his watch or tap the screen. When a Rainbow lands, his excitement is palpable, often pulling out tools to help "collect" your loot.

> **Note:** Because of the Cluster Pay and "Super Cascade" mechanic, the game is highly volatile. You can go many spins with nothing, followed by a single cascade that triggers a chain reaction filling the board with Golden Squares.
